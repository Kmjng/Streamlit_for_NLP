2024-08-27,5,Makes you so pretty! Enhances skin's natural beauty!,"This product is  amazing. I never even thought of looking for something like this until I saw an ad from the 3 letter company that rhymes with ""self"". Well, from past bad experiences with breakouts (sensitive skin) from that brand, I knew to stay away. The good Amazon algorithm came to the rescue and suggested this Lumi Glotion by l'Oreal as a similar item to consider. Thank you! lol! L'oreal is trustworthy quality and gentle on my skin and eyes. I have had great results with other products in the past so, I go for it! So glad I did! This summer, I got to ditch foundations and powders and my skin never looked better than with this! I loved that I could simplify my routine and still looks so pretty! I just did my usual skin care routine, including moisturizer and sunscreen. Then dot this on and gently blend with fingers. It blends with ease! This stuff truly enhances your skin's natural beauty. Somehow, it allows your actual true skin to come through (foundation and powder does not!). Yet, as sheer as it is, it seems to even, blur, and smooth everything out! All while giving you a soft natural glow! My skin had a polished yet very natural finished look just like that! I was nervous it would make me look too oily or shiny but no. Just start light and add more where you want more highlight. After that, I just add brow gel, mascara and light lip tint. Then I feel ready for anything. For reference, I have a warm chocolate skin tone. So the ""deep"" was perfect. L'oreal has done a wonderful job of inclusivity here! There is a shade that works for every women and they manged to do this without me having to break the bank! Worth it! Do proceed to buy!"
2024-08-22,5,Great Versatile Product!,Just purchased this in a darker shade (medium) than I normally wear (light) with the light I use it for a glow and just a little bit of color. I have used it underneath my foundation and also mixing it with the foundation and if I'm running out of the house just for a quick errand by itself as a tint/moisturizer.I am using the medium now because my face is not as tan as the rest of my body.  I cover my face all the time with full sunscreen.  I mix  this with my foundation that is too light for a bronzier look.  Or just go a little darker by adding more for  a semi self tanner.The lotion is easy to apply and also easy to control tint. You could always build up by adding more.This will be an essential staple in my make up kit from now on.
2024-09-23,5,Perfection,Wow! I absolutely love how this product gives my skin a soft dewy glow. It is lightweight coverage that I like to wear on its own. I usually don't need anything else and it's perfect when I'm just needing to get out the door quickly. I will probably buy a few more to stock up!
2024-07-28,4,"Just use a little on my cheeks ,  It’s shimmery looking","I’m a older women with great grand children.I do Use a moisturizer, eye cream,?and lite makeup and I was feeling my face was looking  dry, pasty  and old. ! Lol.I bought this from all the good reviews , but there Allot younger then me!When I first put this on I thought I used a little, but every line, in my face lite up!This is shimmery frosted looking.I did not put  makeup over this  But it was scary looking.I was going to return this.I Gave it a second chance , But Now I just use a little more then a pin head on my fingers and rub it in my cheeks, and use a little blush.  Sometimes a little makeup over this .I like the natural look.My face looks less dry and not pasty.!This feels very moisturizing , or a little greasy!!!This tube will last me a long time!"
2024-09-18,5,This is amazing!,"This has completely transformed my complexion!  I wear it any time I go out and people give me compliments all the time.  I plan to get the shade lighter than this for the winter to keep that sheeny glow without looking too bronzed.  Whether bronzed in the summer or shimmery in the winter, you need to own this product!!!"
2024-08-21,5,love this,"i am addicted to pretty much anything drunk elephant puts out (love them, can't say enough good things about them) and their highlighter dropper thing is phenomenal but i feel like it's almost TOO lightweight to use as a highlighter. someone told me to try this and i love it, not glittery but very dewy and refreshing looking as a highlighter. i use the DE one all over my face first (bc it does have good skincare benefits, i will give them that) and then do my makeup as usual, then finish with the loreal glotion on my cheekbones. i haven't tried this as the base layer but i'm sure it would be jsut as good and a fraction of the price"
2024-09-24,5,Very good product for a nice natural glow,"I was  hesitant but I got it. I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I like this. It goes on smooth, gives you a healthy glow, sunk-kissed almost. Leaves my skin feeling smooth."
2024-09-06,4,Mature skin,"I saw a lot of reviews about how this looks terrible on mature skin, so I was a bit leery, but I bought it anyway. Honestly, it does look really shiny and almost greasy on plain, more mature skin (I’m in my 40’s). It does accentuate pores and wrinkles. BUT if you put it on under a smaller amount of your normal foundation, it gives a really nice dewy glow to the skin. I definitely like it, but if your skin is more mature, you might not be able to wear it alone."
2024-08-24,4,"Natural Glow Enhancer,",I thought I was getting a foundation with a glow to it. This is NOT. I have a glow enhancer already but. I was out of foundation and foundation a foundation in my drawer that was too light but it was a full coverage foundation which is what I’ve been looking For. I put on the foundation followed by the enhancer and got the perfect color and glow I’d been looking for.It goes on good without streaking. If this is your purpose for purchasing this than you’ve chosen the right product but it is NOT A FOUNDATION.!
2024-09-22,4,Pretty good,If I use it with setting powder it’s perfect in my opinion. The powder dials down the intensity just enough for me otherwise sometimes it’s too dark for my skin or even sparkly since it has a sparkle/glitter/glow to it.
2024-09-18,4,Es un iluminador en crema,"Yo compré y lo usé y es como cualquier iluminador convencional, no veo nada extraordinario más que eso.En un video había visto que si mezclas con base queda una iluminación hermosa, la verdad que para mí sigue siendo un iluminador tradicional"
2024-09-25,5,Add to Cart,I’m on my 3rd bottle. One of my favorite things in my makeup drawer. I use it in place of foundation for beach vacations and almost everything else! I love this stuff.
2024-09-22,5,Smooth.,"A little bit goes a long to blend in with your skin without looking heavy.  No shine, just like a second, smooth skin.  Wears all day without changing color or texture."
2024-09-17,5,Better than high-end.,"I love this stuff. I often mix a little bit into my tinted face moisturizer for daily wear, and sometimes I'll add it to my body lotion to a subtle glow. I've tried the high-end stuff, but this is my favorite."
2024-09-04,5,Love this!,I love this so much!! I apply it under makeup and it gives my face such a pretty glow. I have oily skin so and most other liquid highlights I’ve tried are greasy or make my skin look even more oily. What I love about this is that it’s not greasy at all and still adds a nice glow. 10/10 would recommend! Especially for the price.
2024-09-22,5,Love this makeup!,I'm 65 with blotchy skin. This goes on so smooth and gives a dewy and very light shimmer. No caking or drying. No settling in to wrinkles.
2024-09-07,5,GREAT for mature skin!,"I’m probably not their target demographic, but when I saw this I had to give it a try. I’m 52 and my skin has become noticeably dull. I was a 80s sun worshipper like my fellow GenXers and only recently started taking better care of my skin…better late than never. This stuff is light and brightens my face enough to wear with or without makeup. In this pic I have zero makeup on and I think it brightens me up enough to avoid looking like a corpse when I don’t wear makeup."
2024-09-10,5,Perfect light weight,I have ordered this several times. It is the best to just throw on and go out. It keeps my skin looking good. I don’t break out from this as I do many others. I think this is better than drunk elephant. It also is a good base if needed!
2024-09-07,5,Easy trick for a skin confidence boost,"I’m not a huge make up person, but I absolutely love this product. It gives me a confidence boost with my skin even just wearing it on its own fantastic color not too much shimmer just enough glow to make you look hydrated and a little tan."
2024-08-14,5,I LOVE IT!,I'll be using this for life. It's perfect my skin. I ditched foundation a while ago because I didn't need it. My skin is clear but I still wanted something light so that my powder blush would set right. Something that was not tacky or greasy. This is it. I like the way it feels and it looks great. It wasn't dry or oily. The last product I tried in this category felt tacky and too shiny and it was 3x the price of this. It made my pores look huge. This actually minimized the appearance of my pores. Don't be fooled by the products that are more expensive. This was so reasonably priced and I'm very pleased.
2024-08-19,4,Good,"Was looking for a cheaper alternative to a favorite tinted moisturizer. This product is good for the price, definitely not quite up to my expectation but do like it. Helps add a little glow, it is completely sheer, so don’t expect any coverage and seems to kind of wear off after a few hours. I think it’s perfect for the summer, if you don’t want much , just a little glow."
2024-09-23,5,Love this,It’s not heavy on my skin & I apply it like a foundation over my BB cream
2024-09-06,5,Love the texture,"Goes on smooth, very moisturizing, and looks all natural. It is not full coverage so if you have some acne due to hormones like I get monthly it won't cover those spots but when you have clear skin it is great for a simple natural makeup day"

When it comes to beauty trends I always test the waters with affordable, accessible products. Insert L’Oréal Glowtion. Here’s why it’s become a staple in my makeup routine:1. Cost! Can’t beat the value on this one.2. Perfect concentration of highlight pigments! Not too much or too little, just right!3. Multi/purpose product! Great on its own, or as a base for your normal routine.In the video you can see me applying two shades of Glowtion. 903 (medium) all over and 902 (light) in the areas I want to highlight. In the next picture I’ve applied a light brow, eyeshadow and mascara and could stop there and confidently head out for the day. In the next picture I’ve applied full face makeup on top of the Glowtion and still get the subtle highlighting effect of Glowtion, perfect for date night or when you want a little extra coverage.Things to know:1. Glowtion is a zero coverage product. If you are looking for coverage you’ll want to layer it under your face makeup or look into a different product.2. This product is NOT non-comedogenic! If you have oil skin or are prone to breakouts either use a skin type appropriate primer underneath Glowtion or look into a different product to avoid break outs.Overall, I like the weight, consistency and value of L’Oréal Glowtion. Just make sure it’s suitable for your skin type and desired results before purchasing. Happy glowing!"
2024-09-18,5,Just the 'boost' I needed!,At age 66 my skin needed a little boost.  This product gives me a perfect glow that looks natural which is just what I wanted.
2024-09-24,5,Very good,I liked it it makes me look tan
2024-08-31,5,Love: Ordered Repeatedly,This product is great. I use it alone instead of makeup or mix a bit with my CC cream for a nice glow. I have ordered it multiple times and I will likely continue to do so as long as it is available.
2024-07-28,4,Sensitive skin might break out,"I place this strategically after applying foundation and concealer. It gives a pretty glow, enough of a highlight without looking overdone. It’s a softer highlight than any of the powders I have and I like that. I tried it by itself without foundation and also mixed with foundation, but both ways caused breakouts on my ridiculously sensitive skin. I use L’Oreal Infallible foundation, which doesn’t cause me to break out, and hoped that being from the same cosmetic company, this product wouldn’t either. I like it, but I can definitely live without it due to breakouts."
2024-09-23,5,This !,This will have you glowing 😍😍
2024-09-27,5,Love,Adds color and moisture to face
2024-04-24,4,"Good, but not great. Probably won't repurchase.","It looks lovely as a highlighter. I tried it allover based on many stellar review pics stating they did, but am sad to report I had less stunning results. It's an extremely lightweight, but even coverage (fantastic) tinted moisturizer. It does give you a vaguely dewy look, but when you use it all over your face it looses some of that luster. This seems to mean that people in the reviews had other undisclosed makeup on in the pic (especially anyone with rosy cheeks! That had to be blush. It wasn't this) OR used their true shade + one darker to contour, as suggested as 1 of 3 ways to use it on the bottle, to make targeted highlighting and contrast. Either way, it's still a fantastic product if you want a dewy highlighter or dewy tinted moisturizer, just don't expect to look like most of the review pics unless you layer it with other makeup. I don't typically wear makeup, so I'm not looking to add contouring and/blush to the regimen. Given that, I probably won't repurchase but would if I was a regular makeup user looking for an inexpensive dewy tinted moisturizer."
2024-09-10,4,Disappeared when blended,"It looks great at first glance but the moment you blend around skin, it just disappears"
2024-08-27,5,"If you want a glowing look, get this","This simply melts into the skin, takes very little effort to blend, (I like to put a bit of the product on the back of my hand and use a damp beauty blend to apply it) and adds a very nice glow without making you look like a disco ball."
2024-09-13,5,"This doesn't look to ""make-upey""","My co-worker kept asking why I seemed to have this new beautiful glow, she doesn't have to know all my little beauty secrets."
2024-08-19,4,Probably really good,"This is probably a great product, most of L'Oreal products are. But I'm fair complected and 67, so it turned orange on me, I looked like Donald Trump. Lol. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars. So beware if you are fair complected.  I'm sorry I didn't get a picture."
2024-09-15,5,Good product great price,Goes on smooth and gives nice glow healthy look without glitter.  Does not break out skin
2024-08-27,5,Light weight flawless glow slight tint,Absolutely love this product. My body is always tanner than my face so I put this on after my moisturizer. Add a little lighter foundation around my eyes and nose and my face is ready. Gives a sun kiss glow vibe. Will be purchasing again and again.
2024-09-11,5,LOVE it!,I have all good things to say about this product!  I love that I can use it without putting on a full face of makeup!
2024-09-21,5,Happy with my purchase,Not heavy and gives just the right amount of glow.
2024-09-20,5,Blends well!,This product is smooth and beautiful color blend.
2024-09-01,5,It brightens my face and makes feel better about how i look,I LOVE this product.it lightly covers - it stays on - it doesn't smell - it's not expensive - the quality is reliable and best of all it makes my skin look lovely and a bit more youthful
2024-09-22,5,L’Oréal makeup true match,It goes on smoothly and blends in well.
2024-09-24,5,Great item.,Fast delivery.
2024-09-14,5,Glow enhancement,Makes my skin look so much better!
2024-09-03,5,Love this makeuo,I stay outside & sweat profusely!!  This will eventually wipe off but so will thr hi price makeup!! I really like this !!
2024-09-09,5,Love this stuff!,A cheaper version of Zo Skin illuminating serum.  I use this daily for a natural glow.
2024-09-09,5,Natural look,Used alone and also with sunscreen. Really natural look without being heavy or sticky. A little goes a long way.
2024-09-21,5,Good makeup.,Goes on lightly and looks good.
2024-09-15,5,Glow is good,I've used this over a CC cream for a gentle healthy look.  👍👍
2024-08-22,5,"Love, love, love",The lumi glotion is light and offers a suttle brightness for use on its own or under your regular makeup. I now use this everyday. I have the medium shade for the summer months and use the lighter shade in the winter. A must have brightener or bronzer IMO!
2024-09-01,4,Glowy,It give you a nice glowy tint I love using it as foundation only
2024-08-18,4,A 4,I definitely like the product. I would buy it a bit darker than you would think because it does tend to show as more of a foundation or base than a tint. But u definitely love the price and product!
2024-07-28,4,"nice, but loses shine with powder use","Nice color (light) but very little coverage alone. If added to foundation, works fine, but loses shine as soon as you set it with face powder. So it has to be used either alone, mixed with lotion or foundation without powdering, or on top of powder at the very end. Nice, subtle lumination."
2024-09-02,5,Mixes well,I can mix with my sunscreen or moisturizer/sunscreen (oil of Olay) or Elta MD tinted sunscreen ( I use as foundation).
2024-09-09,5,Great product,Fun way to get a glow. Really affordable compared to similar products. I wish the bottle were a bit bigger.
2024-06-14,4,Very light coverage,"This Glotion provides very little coverage but maybe some moisturizing.  I use it over my daytime facial moisturizer/SPF in an attempt to even out my skin tone on no-makeup days.  I don't see a lot of glow but that's okay.  Sometimes I add a light layer of mineral makeup for some extra coverage.  I'm not sure it does a lot, and it has no SPF protection, but I will probably buy it again.  I buy the Fair; perhaps the Light would give me a bit more coverage."
2024-08-20,5,I love it,This is the best thing I’ve seen in a long time. I absolutely love it. It’s so light and you can apply it so fast and the glow it gives on my face. It’s just perfect to me. I really would recommend it.
2024-09-07,4,Pretty Glow,Would buy again
2024-08-21,4,Love,Love this stuff but i recommend getting a shade darker than ur skin tone for the best outcome
2024-08-31,4,Wish it had an SPF,It glows if you use it as the last layer.
2024-09-08,5,Nice light coverage,Nice glow with decent coverage - like a tinted-moisturizer-type coverage.
2024-08-19,5,very pretty,It's very versatile. I've worn it alone and under foundation. It's very nice for looking just a little more put together on no makeup days. Such a great product that I'll probably end up purchasing over and over again.
2024-08-17,4,Easy to use,Nice to Where alone for a little pick me up of your make up or at the end of the day and you're going out it's a great touchup to refreshen your look.
2024-09-14,5,Great glow,We love this product and we will buy again
2024-08-11,5,Go Get some,I love this stuff so much. I will either mix it in with my moisturizer or foundation. It gives me that glowy tan look im looking for. Its kinda subtle so you will have to mix equal parts of whatever your using. I got the darkest shade for this reason. The other ones don’t show up as well as the darkest one. I know that the pale one is great if your actually pale and want to look glowy but the dark one is mostly just to achieve a tan look.
2024-07-07,4,Soft glow,"I have tried it two ways. First put on top of my tinted moisturizer.  Did ok.  Then mixed it with my tinted moisturizer. Liked that better the glow is soft not harsh, too much  looks sweatyL’Oréal is great!  I am a young 74 and have olive skin."
2024-08-27,5,Great Product,Really like this product.  Not heavy on your skin and adds just enough glow.  I use it on the days I don’t want to feel “made up”.
2024-07-25,4,Sparkly,I like it I mix it with my foundation. It will illuminate!!
2024-09-22,5,Easy to apply,Great color
2024-09-11,5,Live this so much,"Love the glow it gives, very lightweight"
2024-08-19,4,Decent product,A bit shiny for me but glad I tried it. Definitely nice shade and value
2024-07-16,4,Perfect amount of glow,for someone that doesn't normally like a glowy makeup look this is the perfect amount of glow under my make up
2024-09-17,5,YAS!!!!!,GET THIS YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED
2024-09-14,5,Bien,Bien
2024-08-24,5,Amazing,This stuff is amazing.  Now even my two adult children are using. This adds some color and the most beautiful glow. NO GLITTER!!  I would have paid a lot more for this. (Please don’t raise price because of this comment) 😅
2024-08-07,5,Evens out skin and adds a beautiful glow!,"I have purchased this in several colors and find myself reaching for it a lot on days I have to be in clinic and don’t feel like a full face of makeup. I love the glow I get on my 46 year old skin and the longevity is great, not a lot of slippage on my skin. Just DEW it!!!"
2024-08-04,5,Satisfied with purcgase,"Love the ease in applying this and how light, smooth and dewy it appears. Clean product thats easy to take off and non pore clogging.  Love the healthy, sunkissed appearance of my skin.."
2024-08-10,5,Love This!,Light weight and feel like it's not even there but provides just the right amount of coverage. I'll be sticking with this one.
2024-08-01,5,Smooth application,Very nice product. I'm 82 and love it. It covers beautifully without looking or feeling like a cover up foundation. A very natural look. I've spent 4 times more $ for products that do not give these results.
2024-06-28,4,Perfect Finish,"Was concerned a “glow enhancer” may be too glittery, or feel too heavy on the skin with makeup.This product is perfect.Creates subtle “glow” on skin and does not feel heavy.I have used it without foundation, under my foundation, and mixed into my foundation, and with all applications it has worked beautifully.Definitely worth the money."
2024-07-24,5,Unbelievable!,"So I am in my 40s and I’ve tried every kind of make up. I hate heavy foundation everything‘s either too heavy or dries your skin out so I decided to give this a try and I believe I’ve never written a view or review on Amazon, but this is totally warranted! This is phenomenal when you use this you literally need no foundation. It’s full coverage. It’s beautiful. I can’t say enough about it. I just went on and ordered three more. !! I got medium it’s perfection!!!"
2024-07-20,4,Good but not great,"It certainly gives you a 'glow', but it is runnier than I expected. I knew it wasn't a true 'foundation' but found it harder to cover my skin than expected. Glad aging actresses are using it and recommending it, but it's not the miracle product I expected.Also, color is darker than I thought it would be. So I bought a lighter color."
2024-08-27,5,Happy customer,Good coverage.  Good color.  Very satisfied
2024-07-29,4,Ehn,"I didn't really expect ""natural glow enhancer"" to mean - it makes your skin oily. But here we are. I don't absolutely hate it, but I live in a humid area and I wouldn't be wearing this if I'm going to be outside."
2024-08-19,5,Youthful looking skin,"Looks good on your face, light weight, not greasy and makes skin look dewy."
2024-08-08,5,BEST Glotion,"THE best glotion it makes you look so bronze and glowy, I use this almost everyday and the best makeup product for the summer."
2024-07-17,5,True dupe for the Elephant drops,"I apply this every day. My daughter does as well. It gives a soft shimmer to your skin. I loath foundation...too thick, too much. This product, combined with a basic moisturizer, gives the perfect base for your make-up routine. The color is medium and nicely covers basic skin blemishes. It's light and feels really great. I am not a make-up queen...I like to spend minimal time on it, but I do want a nice glow! This is perfect for me."
2024-08-24,5,Works well,Color perfectly gives skin a glow
2024-08-27,5,Love it,Wear this alone with no foundation
2024-08-18,5,My new favorite,Love this! You can wear this alone for the no makeup look
2024-08-19,5,Love this!,This stuff works so good and gives me a nice glow
2024-07-15,5,Glow up!,"**L'Oréal Paris True Match Lumi Glotion: My New Skin Savior**I've been on the hunt for a product that could give me that effortless, dewy glow without feeling heavy or greasy, and L'Oréal Paris True Match Lumi Glotion has absolutely delivered! This skin tint is a game-changer.The formula is lightweight and blends seamlessly into my skin, leaving behind a radiant, natural-looking finish. It hydrates my skin without feeling sticky or oily. I love that it gives me a subtle glow without emphasizing any imperfections.I've been using it as a base for my makeup, but it's also perfect for those no-makeup days when I want a quick pick-me-up. The shade range is impressive, making it easy to find the perfect match. Overall, I'm incredibly satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a healthy, luminous complexion."
2024-08-25,5,Highly recommended that product!,Great product! Works great!
2024-08-21,5,Just as described,"Love this, use daily!"
2024-08-05,5,"Readily Absorbs, Nice Finish",This moisturizing lotion does have a subtle tint and glow.  It readily absorbs into the skin and gives a nice finish to skin.  Particularly nice if not wearing makeup.
2024-06-28,4,Sun kissed!!,"I wear minimal make up. Usually just some powder, blush, and mascara. But I have been looking for a tinted moisturizer or cream to use instead of the powder. I got so many compliments the first day I used this. I put it on over my regular Cerave daily lotion and added some blush. I DID feel like there was a fine line between looking “dewey” vs sweaty lol so I did end up adding some powder to my nose and forehead. And to be fair I also have a but if a tan since it’s summer but overall I’m super impressed! Have been using it every work day!"
2024-08-27,5,New favorite,So light and fresh faced look .. no makeup look which is what I wanted doesn't cover like foundation it's amazing
2024-07-31,5,Wonderful On Mature Skin,"After struggling to find a new, light “foundation”, finally, this isn’t!  This product provides moisture, a healthy glow and a hint of color without settling into lines and wrinkles or accentuating them.  It gives skin a youthful glow and just glides on. That said, if you need actual coverage of flaws, you will need to add another product. I use just a touch of cover up on my chin and under eye darkness first, then glide this over my entire face. It works wonderfully!  Don’t change it!"
2024-08-23,4,Not for oily skin,I liked this product it gave me a really pretty glow
2024-08-26,5,Beautiful highlight for the summer.,Gives a nice dewy glow for dry skin or over matte foundation! Just enough color to have a sunkisses look.
